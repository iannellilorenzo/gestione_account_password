# SentinelKey - Password and account manager (Project work)

## Description of the project
SentinelKey is a software for secure password and account management. It allows users to add, remove, and modify their accounts, as well as export all saved accounts to a JSON file. It uses advanced encryption to ensure that passwords are protected. We do not seek any good usage of GitHub other than this README, so you'll find only the ```master``` branch.
